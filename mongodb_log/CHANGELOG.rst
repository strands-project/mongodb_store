0.1.12 (2015-02-09)
-------------------

0.1.11 (2015-02-09)
-------------------
* Extended usage output string by new command line options
* Changed default behaviour back to its former way
  The 'a' command line parameter now activates throttling; not specifying it makes the logger log all tf transformations.
* Added throttling capabilities for high-frequency tf logging
  Added tf logging throttling capabilities originally introduced in https://github.com/code-iai/ros-mongodb_log. A transform is only logged when either this transform has not been logged before, or when the new version of this transform is sufficiently different from the one logged before. Additional command line parameters can be used to control how throttling is done:
  * `-k <d>`: Cartesian (vectorial) distance (in meters) threshold between the old and the new transform
  * `-l <d>`: Angular diastance (in deg) threshold between the old and the new transform
  * `-g <d>`: At least log every transform every `d` seconds, even if nothing changed
  * `-a`: Always log, don't throttle
* Contributors: Jan Winkler

0.0.2 (2014-08-07)
------------------
* Dynamically choose MongoDB API
  Use Connection if using an older mongopy, otherwise use MongoClient.
* Cleaned up boilerplate in mongodb_log package.xml
  Removed a bunch of XML comments (that came from the package.xml
  template) from the package.xml file. Added pymongo as a run dependency.
* Main process no longer calls init_node.
  This fixes bugs related to calling init_node multiple times in the same
  process. Main process now has its own signal handler for shutting down
  cleanly.
* Added 'inserted_at' meta with proper date object to logged data.
  This added compatibility with message store and also allows native date queries on results.
* Changes to how meta info is stored.
* Added boost filesystem for new version of ld.
* Added mongo dependency
* More benchmark removal
* REmoved rrd bits.
* Removing benchmarking stuff.
* Restructuring for new repo position.

Changelog for package mongodb_store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.1.19 (2015-10-28)
-------------------

0.1.18 (2015-10-28)
-------------------
* Split mongodb_store launch file into two.
  This now provides mongodb_store_inc.launch which assumes that a machine tag has been previously set, and is provided by the machine arg. The original mongodb_store.launch file defines a machine tag then calls the _inc.launch file. This design minimises duplication as far as possible, but is still a bit inelegant. The reason we couldn't do everything with a single file, as discussed in `#148 <https://github.com/strands-project/mongodb_store/issues/148>`_, is we can't test whether an argument has been set in roslaunch so we don't know when to define a machine tag ourselves. The additional boolean flag to dictate this definition was not a nice solution either.
  This supercedes  `#148 <https://github.com/strands-project/mongodb_store/issues/148>`_
* Trying to find why cpp test fails. It appears to be a local issue with library paths not getting passed properly. SOme mention of this is here https://github.com/mikepurvis/ros-install-osx/issues/12
* [mongodb_store] add limit argument for query
* [replicator_node.py] add cancel handler for replication
* [mongodb_store/message_store.py] suppress infinite error output when shutdown without finding mongodb service
* Fix: remove auto-generated databases in /tmp after a test has been completed that may e.g. fill up the harddisk of a Jenkins server
* minor help edit
* logging messages commented
* aded support for start and end times of playback
* Contributors: Moritz Tenorth, Nick Hawes, Vojtech Novak, Yuki Furuta

0.1.17 (2015-09-01)

-------------------
* use False as default value of param 'mongodb_use_daemon'
* add option to use already launched mongod
* Fix exception catch.
* Silence wait_for_service.
  This adds some more helpful output if the messages store services can't be found, but produces no output if they are found within 5 seconds.

  MongoClient. Updated scripts to use Connection instead of MongoClient.
  This allows the package to work with the existing rosdep definitions for
  python-pymongo (shich use the .deb version).

* fixed update bug where meta info not updated got dropped from the db
* Made sure name is set correctly with using update named.

  We decided to set these in some way I can't quite recall...

  Also made HOSTNAME optional.
* C++ queries are working in a basic form.

* Cleaned up differences between two commits.
* Added updateID to cpp client.
* Added cpp example of logging multiple messages together.
* Changed order of MessageStoreProxy constructor arguments.
  This was done to allow more natural changing of parameters in a sensible order. It's more likely you want to change collection name first, so that is the first parameter, leaving remainder as default.
* Added point cloud test, but not including in compilation.
* Working binary with pointclouds.
* Added updateID to cpp client.

* Renamed to match convention.
* Added test class for cpp interface.
* Query methods now only return true when something was found.

  Minor formatting.
* Changed to get the deserialisation length from the vector length.
  This removes the bug where variable length types were incorrectly deserialised. Thanks to @nilsbore for reporting the bug.
